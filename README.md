# Web Mutation Timer
A Chrome extension for measuring page load and UI update times using MutationObserver.
## Key Features:

- Page Load Timing: Measure how long it takes for a page to finish rendering dynamic content.
- Action Timing: Start timing after user interactions (clicks, key presses), and stop when the page stabilizes.
- Custom Observation Target: Specify a CSS selector to watch a specific DOM element, or observe the entire page.
- Extended Logging: Optional detailed console logs of all detected DOM mutations with timestamps.
- Persistent & One-time Measurement: Toggle between recording every interaction or just the next one.

Settings are available in the extension's options menu.
